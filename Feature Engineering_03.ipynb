    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical variables into numerical values. However, there is a subtle difference between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding is used when there is a clear order or hierarchy among the categories. For example, suppose we have a dataset containing information about different levels of education, such as \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" and \"Doctorate.\" In this case, we can assign numerical values to each level of education based on their order. For instance, we can assign \"High School\" as 1, \"Bachelor's\" as 2, \"Master's\" as 3, and \"Doctorate\" as 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Label Encoding is used when there is no inherent order or hierarchy among the categories. In this case, we can assign a unique numerical value to each category. For example, if we have a dataset containing information about different types of fruits, such as \"Apple,\" \"Banana,\" \"Orange,\" and \"Mango,\" we can assign \"Apple\" as 1, \"Banana\" as 2, \"Orange\" as 3, and \"Mango\" as 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might choose one over the other depending on the nature of the data and the specific problem we are trying to solve. If there is a clear order among the categories, we should use Ordinal Encoding to preserve that information in our model. On the other hand, if there is no inherent order among the categories, we should use Label Encoding to avoid introducing any spurious relationships in the model.\n"

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique that involves encoding categorical variables based on the target variable to predict. The idea is to create an ordered relationship between the categories of a categorical variable and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps involved in Target Guided Ordinal Encoding are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the target variable in the dataset.\n",
    "2. Group the categories of the categorical variable based on their relationship with the target variable.\n",
    "3. Assign an ordinal value to each group based on the average target value for that group. For example, if there are 5 groups, the ordinal values could range from 1 to 5.\n",
    "4. Replace the categorical variable with the ordinal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of when to use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is in a marketing campaign where you want to predict which customers are most likely to buy a product. The dataset may contain a categorical variable such as \"income level,\" and by using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, you can group the categories based on their relationship with the target variable \"purchase\" and assign an ordinal value to each group based on the average purchase rate. This will create an ordered relationship between the categories of \"income level\" and the likelihood of purchase, allowing you to use this variable in your machine learning model."

    "Covariance is a measure of how two variables are related to each other. Specifically, it measures the joint variability of two random variables. If the two variables tend to vary together in a similar way, the covariance will be positive. If they tend to vary in opposite ways, the covariance will be negative. If the two variables are not related, the covariance will be close to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical analysis, covariance is important because it helps us understand the relationship between two variables. For example, if we are studying the relationship between education level and income, we can use covariance to measure how much variation in income is explained by education level. Covariance can also be used to identify patterns in data and to determine whether certain variables are more or less important in explaining variation in the data.\n",
